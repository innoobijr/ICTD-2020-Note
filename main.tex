\section{Introduction}
Some themes to explore
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interaction between the built and digital environment
		\item Problems and solutions
		\item the need to think of social and urban information architectures in solutions
	\item Ubiquity of mobile computing devices
	\item High costs of data and connectivity
	\item Dense and Recurrent mobility behaviors
	\item Inequality and varying levels of access to digital goods and services
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
Some themes to provide lit reviews on
\subsection{Device to Device Transfers}
\subsection{Resource-constrained networking}
\subsection{Offline community-based internets}
\subsection{Designing for resource constraint environments}
\section{Research Challenges}
Posing some importants research questions we hope to answer through this work
\begin{itemize}
  \item Can we generate a set of design choices that can guide the development and design of offline internets?
  \item Can we discover kernels in hybrid ICT and social computing systems that are scale invariant?
  \item If so, how can we build a sustainable framework of hybrid networking that leverages such a kernel aand local dynamics to support community internets?:
\end{itemize}
\section{Discussion}
Not sure if this section is redundant or can be incorporated more formally into the paper, but it is essentially a place do really push the discussing on questions our appraoches when it comes to internet access to developing communities.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Question the status quo
 \item Hierarchy of needs
\end{itemize}
\section{Evaluation Plan}
I think the goal of this section is to highlight how we are going to attempt to answer some of these research questions. Obviously the first part, is maybe a blueprints or spec that is generated from your thesis.But in so far as we are concerned with understand how to understand those complex interactions we discussed a while ago and the need for sustainability, we will have to be more explicit about how we will answer those questions.
